content based filtering:
- get all the features we want (synopsis, genre, rating)
- preprocess/clean the data in features (drop null values etc.)

- use Tfid vectorizer on the synopsis and genre features
    - rating will be treated separately 
- calculate cosine similarity of the above feature vectorizer

- features with numeric data types (rating, episodes, members) will be weighted separately
