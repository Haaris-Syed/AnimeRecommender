The datasets used have been removed from the project as they were too large to include in the submission file. Please use the following link to access the dataset. Download the files "animes.csv" and "reviews.csv". Do not download "profiles.csv" as this was not used in the project.

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews?resource=download&select=animes.csv

Upon downloading these files, add them to the "datasets" folder present in the project directory. This is an empty folder present to store the datasets for when you download them. 

Once this is done, please follow the "User Guide" section in the final report to run the code.
